4.  **`sensai-ai/run_checkpoint_tests.py` (New File):**
    *   **Purpose:** This is a crucial new script for automating the testing process. It manages the backend server (starting and stopping it), runs specific pytest tests based on defined "checkpoints" (e.g., `phase_1_models`, `phase_1_service`, `phase_3_api`, `full_integration`), and generates detailed JSON reports.
    *   **Impact:** Significantly improves the development workflow by enabling automated, structured testing. This is essential for ensuring the stability and correctness of the complex SAQ evaluation system, especially with LLM integrations. It allows developers to quickly verify changes at different stages of development.

5.  **`sensai-ai/src/api/models.py` (Modified):**
    *   **Purpose:** Re-introduces and refines the Pydantic models for SAQ evaluation (`SemanticEvaluationResult`, `DynamicFeedback`, `SAQEvaluationRequest`). These models were likely present in an earlier, uncommitted state or were part of a previous iteration that was refined and formally added in this commit.
    *   **Impact:** Solidifies the data contracts for the SAQ evaluation system, ensuring consistency and validation of data flowing through the backend.

6.  **`sensai-ai/src/api/routes/assessment.py` (Modified):**

Comparison with Previous Commit (`03527705ca0400289a1f7bd2c98d98a16157595e` - "sb/feat: phase 2 mvp3"):

The previous commit introduced the basic framework for interactive quizzes and integrity logging, including the `QuizManager` and `QuizSession` in `websockets.py`, and initial API endpoints for integrity logs and quiz answers. It also updated the frontend to support these basic interactions.

This current commit (`e5727e80ef3a414f7268aa6b6545a5d6590fddb9`) takes the SAQ evaluation to the next level by:
*   **Implementing the core SAQ evaluation logic:** The `saq_evaluator.py` service is the heart of this, providing semantic analysis and dynamic feedback. This was a conceptual placeholder in the previous commit's `TODO_SAQ_Enhancement.md` and is now a concrete implementation.
*   **Deepening the integration:** The `assessment.py` route now actively uses the `SAQEvaluatorService` for SAQ questions, enabling the interactive retry logic.
*   **Building a robust testing framework:** The sheer volume of new test-related files (`run_checkpoint_tests.py`, `test_runner.bat`, `tests/README.md`, `tests/data/test_scenarios.json`, `test_saq_evaluation_integration.py`, `test_utils.py`, `pytest.ini`) indicates a strong focus on ensuring the quality and reliability of the new SAQ features. This was largely absent in the previous commit, which focused more on initial feature implementation.
*   **Comprehensive Documentation:** The new `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`, `MVP4_STEPS.md`, and `TODO_SAQ_Enhancement.md` provide detailed insights into the project's progress, future plans, and technical design, which were not present in such depth before.

Conclusion:
This commit represents a critical phase in the project, moving from initial feature implementation to a mature, well-tested, and documented AI-powered SAQ evaluation system. The emphasis on automated testing and detailed documentation suggests a commitment to high-quality software engineering practices. The SAQ evaluation is now fully functional on the backend, awaiting complete frontend integration.
