# New Features in Sensai-hyperverge

This document provides an in-depth overview of the significant new features introduced in the Sensai-hyperverge project, detailing their purpose, implementation, and impact.

## 1. Advanced AI-Powered Short Answer Question (SAQ) Evaluation System

### Purpose
To revolutionize the assessment process by moving beyond simple keyword matching to semantically understand student responses for short answer questions. This system provides intelligent, nuanced, and dynamic feedback, fostering a more effective and interactive learning experience.

### Implementation Details
-   **Core Evaluation Logic (`sensai-ai/src/api/services/saq_evaluator.py`):**
    -   A new `SAQEvaluatorService` class orchestrates a multi-step evaluation process.
    -   **Semantic Evaluation:** The `semantic_evaluation` method leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) (specifically `gpt-4o-mini` via the `instructor` library for structured output) to compare a student's answer against an ideal answer. It assesses semantic similarity, returning a `correctness` score (0.0-1.0) and a `feedback_category` (correct, partially_correct, incorrect). This allows for a granular and human-like assessment of understanding.
    -   **Dynamic Feedback Generation:** The `generate_dynamic_feedback` method dynamically crafts tailored feedback based on the semantic evaluation:
        -   For **correct** answers, it provides simple, positive reinforcement.
        -   For **partially correct** answers, it generates an encouraging hint (using another LLM call) that guides the student towards the missing information without directly revealing the answer. This promotes critical thinking and self-correction.
        -   For **incorrect** answers, it provides a concise, constructive explanation of why the answer was wrong and points towards the correct answer.
-   **Data Models (`sensai-ai/src/api/models.py`):**
    -   New Pydantic models (`SemanticEvaluationResult`, `DynamicFeedback`, `SAQEvaluationRequest`) were introduced to ensure type safety, validation, and clear data contracts for LLM interactions and the overall evaluation flow.
-   **API Integration (`sensai-ai/src/api/routes/assessment.py`):**
    -   The existing `/quiz/answer` endpoint was significantly enhanced to integrate the `SAQEvaluatorService` for SAQ type questions.
    -   The `QuizFeedback` model was extended to include rich, dynamic feedback fields (`feedback_type`, `hint`, `explanation`, `requires_retry`), enabling the frontend to display interactive feedback.
    -   A crucial feature is the interactive retry logic: if an SAQ answer is `partially_correct` and `requires_retry` is true, the system keeps the student on the same question, allowing them to refine their answer based on the AI-generated hint.

### Impact
This feature transforms the assessment experience from a static, pass/fail system into a dynamic, adaptive, and highly personalized learning tool. Students receive immediate, intelligent feedback that helps them understand their misconceptions and guides them towards mastery, significantly enhancing the educational value of the platform.

## 2. Quiz Integrity Monitoring

### Purpose
To enhance the fairness and validity of online quizzes by actively monitoring user behavior for potential integrity breaches, providing data for proctoring and behavioral analytics.

### Implementation Details
-   **Data Models (`sensai-ai/src/api/models.py`):**
    -   `IntegrityEvent` and `IntegrityLog` models were introduced/enhanced to define the structure of behavioral data captured during a quiz session. This includes event types like `PASTE_DETECTED` (detecting copy-pasting), `TAB_UNFOCUSED`/`TAB_FOCUSED` (tracking tab switching), and `PAGE_UNLOADED` (detecting premature page exits).
-   **API Endpoints (`sensai-ai/src/api/routes/assessment.py`):**
    -   New endpoints (`/assessment/integrity-log` and `/assessment/clear-session/{session_id}`) were created to allow the frontend to send these detailed integrity events to the backend for logging and subsequent analysis.

### Impact
This feature provides the foundational data necessary for implementing robust proctoring and behavioral analytics systems, helping to maintain the integrity of assessments and ensure a fair testing environment for all users.

## 3. Comprehensive Testing Framework

### Purpose
To ensure the robustness, correctness, and reliability of the entire application, especially the complex AI-driven SAQ evaluation system. This framework significantly improves development efficiency and code quality.

### Implementation Details
-   **Automated Checkpoint Tests (`sensai-ai/run_checkpoint_tests.py` & `sensai-ai/test_runner.bat`):**
    -   A new Python script (`run_checkpoint_tests.py`) and a Windows batch script (`test_runner.bat`) were developed to automate the testing process. These scripts manage the backend server (starting and stopping it as needed), run specific `pytest` tests based on predefined "checkpoints" (e.g., `phase_1_models`, `phase_1_service`, `phase_3_api`, `full_integration`), and generate detailed JSON reports.
-   **Extensive Integration Test Suite (`sensai-ai/tests/integration/test_saq_evaluation_integration.py`):**
    -   This is the primary test file for the SAQ evaluation system, containing `pytest` tests that cover:
        -   **Model Validation:** Ensuring Pydantic models are correctly structured and validated.
        -   **Service Layer Functionality:** Testing the core logic of `SAQEvaluatorService` by mocking LLM responses for isolated and efficient testing.
        -   **API Endpoint Behavior:** Verifying that the FastAPI endpoints correctly process requests and return expected responses.
        -   **Full Integration Flows:** Simulating end-to-end user interactions to ensure the entire system works cohesively.
-   **Reusable Testing Utilities (`sensai-ai/tests/utils/test_utils.py`):**
    -   **`TestLogger`:** A custom, detailed logging system that outputs timestamped logs to both console and files, crucial for debugging complex AI interactions by capturing LLM prompts and responses.
    -   **`TestDataFactory`:** Centralizes the creation of diverse test data (e.g., SAQ questions of varying difficulty, different types of student answers) to make tests more readable and comprehensive.
    -   **`MockDataGenerator`:** Provides methods to simulate LLM responses, enabling efficient testing of LLM-dependent components without making actual, slow, and expensive API calls.
    -   Includes `TestValidators` for asserting data structures and `TestResultsAnalyzer` for summarizing test outcomes.
-   **Structured Test Data & Configuration:** New `test_scenarios.json` and `test_data.json` provide organized test data, while `pytest.ini` standardizes `pytest` execution and enables selective test runs.

### Impact
This robust testing framework significantly increases confidence in the correctness, stability, and reliability of the new features. It accelerates the development cycle by providing a strong safety net for refactoring and new additions, and greatly aids in debugging complex AI-driven logic.

## 4. Enhanced User Interface for Quizzes

To provide an intuitive, engaging, and interactive experience for users taking quizzes, particularly with the new SAQ evaluation capabilities and integrity monitoring.

### Implementation Details
-   **AI Question Generator Page (`sensai-frontend/src/app/assessment/page.tsx`):**
    -   A new dedicated page allowing users to upload PDF documents and instantly generate comprehensive MCQ and SAQ questions using AI.
    -   Features client-side validation for PDF file types and size limits (5MB).
    -   Includes client-side caching for generated quizzes, allowing users to revisit and manage previously generated question sets.
    -   Provides options to download generated questions as JSON and initiate a quiz session directly from the page.
-   **Interactive Quiz Session (`sensai-frontend/src/app/quiz/[sessionId]/page.tsx` & `sensai-frontend/src/components/QuizChat.tsx`):**
    -   A new dynamic page (`/quiz/[sessionId]`) serves as the main interface for interactive quizzes.
    -   The `QuizChat` component provides a chat-based interface for taking quizzes, displaying questions, receiving student answers, and presenting dynamic feedback (including hints and explanations) from the backend.
    -   Integrates integrity event logging directly from the frontend, sending events like tab focus changes and paste detections to the backend.
-   **Reviewer Timeline (`sensai-frontend/src/components/ReviewerTimeline.tsx`):**
    -   A new component designed to visualize the integrity logs for a specific quiz session, providing a chronological overview of user behavior for review purposes.
-   **Question Type Mapping:** Utility functions (`mapQuestionTypeToAPI`, `mapQuestionTypeFromAPI`) were added in `LearnerQuizView.tsx` and `QuizEditor.tsx` to ensure seamless and consistent communication of question types between the frontend and backend API.

### Impact
These UI enhancements significantly improve user engagement and clarity during quizzes. The interactive feedback loop for SAQ questions, coupled with the ability to generate quizzes from PDFs and monitor integrity, creates a powerful and user-friendly assessment platform.

## 5. Streamlined Development Environment

### Purpose
To simplify the setup, development, and management of the project's backend and frontend services, making it easier for developers to contribute.

### Implementation Details
